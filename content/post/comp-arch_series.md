Ever since my last post, I've been struggling with ideas on what to write about. All things considered, my overall options are somewhat limitless due to the nature of technology. So in the end, there shouldn't be _that_ much of an excuse to just pick a topic and write about, right?

Turns out: it kind of can be. You see, I could come up with a series of disjointed posts that are all related simply by being part of technology. However, it lacks a cohesive purpose. Am I simply writing for the post of pushing out posts, or writing for the sake of providing solid and concise information?

It wasn't until the last two weeks that, as I was trying to learn different tools for binary analysis (I should note that my undergrad didn't focus so much on these types of topics as it was more focused towards hardware) that I realized I had never bothered to learn x86 assembly. Even more shocking was, despite me approaching one year since I've graduated with my Master's, my knowledge in architecture has dulled. This last weekend I had spent (rather foolishly) in trying to patch up any missing gaps in my knowledge before realizing that it is perhaps for the best to go back to square one. Thankfully, it shouldn't be that much harder to do this time around.

It wasn't until this morning that I realized I could perhaps post a series of articles talking about the fundamentals of computer architecture, and also seeing about connecting it to some real world cases.

Currently, I don't plan on having a set schedule to post as I'd like so as to not be under too much pressure of trying to meet a deadline, but can at least make sure to be consistent about the posting. Currently, my plan is to start discussing **instruction set architectures**, as I feel that this is the most fundamental building block of computer architecture.

Finally, I want to mention that I am super excited to finally have some solid motivation on pursuing additional posts, and looking forward to seeing where it takes me!

The feature image shown in this article was generated by Stable Diffusion. The following was the prompt used in the generation of the image: _A die, in the context of integrated circuits, is a small block of semiconducting material on which a given functional circuit is fabricated. Many of the circuits form distinct functional blocks on the die. These blocks should take on the appearance of a metropolis that receives electricity to properly operate. This is visible through copper traces that run throughout, interconnecting every aspect of the layout._

For those unaware of how computer dies look like, below is a snapshot of computer dies on a silicon wafer chip. The process on how sand becomes a computer chip is super fascinating, and may in fact become a separate post in the future.
