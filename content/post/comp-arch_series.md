Ever since my last post, I've been struggling with ideas on what to write about. All things considered, my overall options are somewhat limitless due to the nature of technology. So in the end, there shouldn't be _that_ much of an excuse to just pick a topic and write about, right?

Turns out: it kind of can be. You see, I could come up with a series of disjointed posts that are all related simply by being part of technology. However, it lacks a cohesive purpose. Am I simply writing for the post of pushing out posts, or writing for the sake of providing solid and concise information?

The above question has been sitting on the back burner for a bit, as I've recently decided to switch gears in my professional life. My undergrad studies focused more on the systems-level stuff: a healthy dose of circuit theory, sprinkled with the core sequence of data structures & algorithms, with the rest being on how a computer works. In no way did I ever learn much about tools used in binary analysis, which has some effective use cases depending on the context. One weekend, I attempted to learn about `objdump` and how to read the output. After a lot of trial and error, and finally getting it to spit out the main section of code, I had realized that my knowledge of x86 assembly was non-existent. Naturally, this led me to try and learn it, but yet another roadblock appeared: my knowledge in architecture had dulled! This took me for a surprise, namely in that it hasn't even been a full year since I had completed my Master's. I then realized the opportunity I had available before me: to relearn the core fundamentals of computer architecture and take it as an opportunity to also develop posts around it!

Admittedly, this took me by suprise: it hasn't even been a full year since I had completed my Master's! However, as luck would have it, this roadblock came with an opportunity for me to not only review the core fundamentals of computer architecture, but that a series of posts discussing them would be a good starting point for me to start posting regularly.

Currently, I don't plan on having a set schedule to post as I'd like so as to not be under too much pressure of trying to meet a deadline, but can at least make sure to be consistent about the posting. Currently, my plan is to start discussing **instruction set architectures**, as I feel that this is the most fundamental building block of computer architecture.

Finally, I want to mention that I am super excited to finally have some solid motivation on pursuing additional posts, and looking forward to seeing where it takes me!

The feature image shown in this article was generated by Stable Diffusion. The following was the prompt used in the generation of the image: _A die, in the context of integrated circuits, is a small block of semiconducting material on which a given functional circuit is fabricated. Many of the circuits form distinct functional blocks on the die. These blocks should take on the appearance of a metropolis that receives electricity to properly operate. This is visible through copper traces that run throughout, interconnecting every aspect of the layout._

For those unaware of how computer dies look like, below is a snapshot of computer dies on a silicon wafer chip. The process on how sand becomes a computer chip is super fascinating, and may in fact become a separate post in the future.
