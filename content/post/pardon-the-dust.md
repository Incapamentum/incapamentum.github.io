Please allow me to welcome you to my blog! Currently, it is barebones, but I had a goal of (at the very least) launch it sometime in July and I think it's beginning to be long overdue.

This blog is built using the [Hugo Clarity](https://github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity) by Chip Zoller. I found it to be sleek, modern, and aesthetically-pleasing (not to mention pretty quick to get it up and running and with a focus on rendering Markdown documents are huge pluses ðŸ™‚).

I hope that, by the end of the month, this blog is fully realized and everything updated. You can definitely see me making use of some content that I do _not_ own, nor hold copyright to, and am just currently using it as an active placeholder. Same goes for some of the content of the sample site as well.

If you stuck around long enough, I thank you and hope you check back periodically for updates on things going on!
