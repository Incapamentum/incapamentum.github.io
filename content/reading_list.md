Growing up, reading was my escape from a world filled with bullying (and a ton of insecurities). It allowed me to explore different ideas, thoughts, and concepts. And above all, it served as a way to develop myself.

As time went on, however, I've fallen out of that habit. I'm seeking to at the very least establish some routine in reading books, and figured maintaining a reading list would be one way of doing so.

As such, this will be a living reading list: I'll keep adding to it and possibly reorder, but won't necessarily delete any books unless they (or the author) turn out to be irrevocably unredeemable due to their actions, thoughts, or beliefs.
